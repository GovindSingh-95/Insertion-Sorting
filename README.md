# Insertion-Sorting
<h2>What is it</h2>
<p>
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time by making comparisons.It,is a stable sorting algorithm.<br>
<br>It works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list.<br>
<br>The algorithm maintains two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards.With,element at 0 index to be part of sorted Array<br>
<br>Similar to sorting playing cards in your hands, you pick a card from the unsorted group and insert it in the right place in the sorted group.<br>
<br>Time complexity in worst and average case is O(n^2),while in best case it is O(n)<br>
